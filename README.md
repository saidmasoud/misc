## Coding Problems

- K Closest Points ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaYX0Ee0Kcg)): Given a set of plots on a Cartesian plane, calculate the k (where k is the number of plots to calculate) closest points to the origin.

- Longest Consecutive Characters ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRNB8CV3_LU)): Given a string, find the longest subsequence consisting of a single character.  Example: longest("ABAACDDDBBA") should return {'D': 3}.
